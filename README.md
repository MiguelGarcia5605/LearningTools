## 3. Install GitHub and Hook Your Repository

GitHub is used for version control and collaboration in FRC. Setting up a repository allows you to save and share your code with your team.

1. Install GitHub Desktop:
   - Download from [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
   - Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Clone or initialize a repository:
   - Open GitHub Desktop and click **File > Clone Repository** if youâ€™re cloning an existing one.
   - To create a new repository, select **File > New Repository**.
3. Link your local repository with GitHub:
   - In VS Code, open the integrated terminal.
   - Run the following commands to link your local folder to the remote GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. Your repository is now linked, and any future code changes can be managed with Git.
